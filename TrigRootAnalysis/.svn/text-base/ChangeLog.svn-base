	* Add some additional maps for algorithm name hash and algorithm name type has.
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-01-07

2014-02-03 Tim Martin <Tim.Martin@cern.ch>
  * Add ability (in the RootCore side of things) to parse extended menu
    configuration information added by Trig Cost Monitoring.
  * Designed in mind for use in conjunction with TrigCostRootAnalysis package.
  * Access to trigger chains, signatures, sequences, algorithms.
  * Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-01-06

2012-08-24 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Fixed a long-standing problem. VarHandle now explicitly
	  turns off the "MakeClass status" of the input TTree, as
	  this clashes with the way VarHandle accesses the branches.
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-01-05

2012-07-24 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Under certain circumstances ROOT may not find a dictionary
	  for std::vector<short>, which is needed to read the HLT
	  trigger decision. So, I explicitly added this dictionary
	  to the package. Hopefully it won't clash with the
	  built-in dictionary too much. (In the cases where it
	  wouldn't be needed...)
	* Tagging TrigRootAnalysis-00-01-04

2012-07-24 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Fixed the "visibility setting" of the BranchAvailability
	  enumeration in VarHandleBase. This fixes the compilation
	  using clang. (GCC doesn't pick up on this bug...)
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-01-03

2012-06-22 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added the latest VarHandle implementation to the package
	  from the D3PDReader code generator. (With the statistics
	  collection stripped off.)
	* This was needed to fix some small memory leaks that were
	  present in the previous implementation.
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-01-02

2012-05-29 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Making it possible in the new code as well to update the
	  trigger configuration metadata tree used by the stand-alone
	  TDT object.
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-01-01

2012-05-25 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Made a *lot* of changes.
	* Modified the base classes of TrigDecisionToolD3PD not to
	  depend directly on TrigConfigSvcD3PD, but only on the
	  IITrigConfigSvcD3PD interface.
	* Introduced the IITrigDecisionToolD3PD and
	  ITrigDecisionToolD3PD interfaces.
	* Created the TrigDecisionToolAthD3PD implementation to be
	  used in Athena D3PD analyses.
	* Only tested the code in Athena and PyROOT so far, could
	  possibly still have issues in standalone ROOT mode.
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-01-00

2012-05-24 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Started a large scale rewrite.
	* TrigConfigSvcD3PD no longer needs constant access to the
	  metadata tree, it now reads in all data when the TTree
	  is given to it, and then releases it.
	* Created some interfaces for the trigger configuration
	  service.
	* Added an Athena service to the package, which wraps
	  D3PD::TrigConfigSvcD3PD, and provides the configuration
	  data for the current event in an Athena environment.
	* Not tagging for the moment, as other big updates will
	  follow in the TDT code.

2012-04-22 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Playing a bit with C++11. Added some nice optimizations in
	  TrigDecisionToolD3PD.cxx that depend on the new language
	  features.
	* Extended Makefile.standalone to make it possible to compile
	  the package in the C++0x mode of GCC or Clang.
	* When not in C++11 mode, the compiler gets the same code
	  as before.
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-00-09

2012-02-24 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Extended Makefile.standalone to play nicely with
	  ROOT 5.32
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-00-08

2011-12-01 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Updated ChainGroupHandling so that it wouldn't print an
	  error message when somebody creates a ChainGroup before
	  the first file is opened.
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-00-07

2011-11-25 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Using functions on a ChainGroup now makes sure that
	  the correct configuration is loaded when the ChainGroup
	  functions are evaluated. (Prescales could be wrong in
	  the past...)
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-00-06

2011-11-21 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a parameter to GetConfigSvc(...) which can disable the
	  auto-loading of the configuration for the current event.
	  (When you define a new configuration tree after you opened
	  a new file, you don't want the tool trying to access a
	  non-existent tree in memory.)
	* Made the functions in IDataAccess public, as these can be
	  useful in many situations. (One couldn't use the enumeration
	  defined in this class before this.)
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-00-05

2011-11-21 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Changed the code such that when the user calls the
	  GetConfigSvc() function on the TDT, it would always be
	  ensured to be in the correct state for the current
	  event. (So far the higher level functions made sure
	  one by one that the correct configuration is loaded.)
	* Added some documentation for Doxygen.
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-00-04

2011-10-31 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a new suite of functions for listing all the triggers
	  from an event, or from a chain group that passed in the
	  current event. This should help in some interactive
	  analyses, or analyses running on just a few events.
	* TrigConfigSvcD3PD can now look up LVL1 items and HLT chains
	  based on their CTP/Chain Id.
	* Added some extra protection against failures in some places.
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-00-03

2011-09-28 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Small fix for RootCore compilation on MacOS X Lion.
	  (libTree is somehow not loaded by default under ROOT
	  5.30.01 there...)
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-00-02

2011-09-05 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Created this new package based on the ROOT-only sources
	  that were in the TriggerD3PDMaker package so far.
	* The code can be compiled in 3 ways at the moment:
	  - In the Athena environment like any other CMT package
	  - Using RootCore
	  - Using a completely standalone Makefile
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-00-01
